# Sockets-ChatApp
Socket-ChatApp is a basic server and client communication system between two nodes on a network. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other attempts to connect with that socket to form a connection. My application specifically imitates chat programs like WhatsApp, where users can direct message other users just by their IP addresses. A host is required to run server.py at all times and anyone interested can use the client.py to establish a connetion with other users using client.py. 

# How To Install
- git clone https://github.com/CuriousAvenger/Sockets-ChatApp
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python3 server.py or client.py # Python3 Required
